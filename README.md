# :computer_mouse: Canvas UI

Canvas-drawn IMGUI library in JavaScript with:

* virtual editable tree-grid that can load, sort and filter 100K records instantly and scrolls @ 60 fps.
* data-bound widgets for data entry, navigation and reporting.
* layouting widgets for split-pane layouts common in data-dense business applications.
* efficient native p2p screen-sharing, consuming only 2 Mbps @ 60 fps.
* RAD UI designer.
* pluggable layouting algorithms.
* built-in flex layouting.
* built-in popup positioning and z-layering.
* styling system for colors and spacing better than CSS.
* animations better than CSS.
* no dependencies.
* IMGUI, so stateless, no DOM updating or diff'ing because there is no ODM.
