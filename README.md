# :computer_mouse: Canvas UI

UI library in JavaScript: canvas-drawn, no dependencies, IMGUI API,
built-in remote screen sharing.

## Highlights

* virtual editable tree-grid:
	* scrolls 1 million records @ 60 fps
	* loads, sorts and filters 100K records instantly
	* grouping by multiple columns
	* bulk offline changes
	* master-detail with client-side and server-side detail filtering
* data-bound widgets for data entry: editbox, dropdown, etc.
* split-pane layouting widgets: tabs list and splitter.
* p2p screen-sharing, needs only 2-5 Mbps to get 60 fps on a relatively dense UI.
* UI designer for templates.
* flex layouting.
* popup positioning.
* z-layering.
* styling system for colors and spacing better than CSS.
* animations better than CSS.
* IMGUI, so stateless, no DOM updating or diff'ing.
* no dependencies, no build system, small, hackable code base.
* possible to add new layouting algorithms.

## Why canvas-drawn?

Sidestepping the DOM and CSS allows fixing all the [problems with the web][1],
at once, and opens up opportunities to create better models for UIs in general.
For instance, the IMGUI approach is reactive by design, but implementing a
reactive system on top of the DOM is complicated, slow and full of trade-offs.
Composable, smart styling is also harder with CSS than with JS where anything
is dynamic (eg. the text color is inverted automatically based on background
lightness). Remote screen sharing would also be hard to implement efficiently
on top of a DOM, but it comes almost for free with the command array model.
Virtual widgets like a data grid that has to display a million rows is harder
to implement by moving DOM elements around when you could just draw the visible
row range at an offset.

## Limitations of canvas-drawn

With canvas, you have to reimplement the web from scratch: layouting, styling,
animations, box model, etc. Most of these are easy and you can even
do a better job with not a lot of code. But some are infeasible because
of missing APIs. Text APIs in particular are very crude
in the browser, so things like BiDi (UAX#9), Unicode line breaking (UAX#14),
dictionary-based word wrapping, underlines that break under letter stems,
all those things are hard, and we'll just have to do without.
